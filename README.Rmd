# velo
velo is an R package which provides bicycle-related calculations frequently used by bike enthusiasts. Until now many of these functions are spread over the web, are unreliable mostly due to insufficient documentation and/or do not exist.
The main goals of the velo-package are:

* Bring together the most important bicycle-related calculations in a well-documented, transparent and reproducible manner (well, so far, the package consists of four functions ...).

* In the future, RShiny should make the implemented functions interactively usable.

You can install the latest development version from github with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
    install.packages("devtools")    
    }
if (!"lazyeval" %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]) {
devtools::install_github("hadley/lazyeval")  
}
devtools::install_github("jannes-m/velo")
```

## TO DO
- function calc_chain also for Fixies
- function trail (Vorlauf, Dirk wants to implement it)
- implement functions in RShiny
