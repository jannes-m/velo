# velo

velo is an R package which provides bicycle-related calculations which are frequently used by bike enthusiasts. However, many of these functions are spread over the web and/or do not exist.
The main goals of the velo-package are:

* Make available the most important bicycle-related calculations in one place (well, so far, there is just one function, ...).

* In the future, RShiny should make the implemented functions interactively usable.


You can install the latest development version from github with

    ``` r
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("hadley/lazyeval")
    devtools::install_github("jannes-m/velo")
    ```
